# âœ… Scenario-Based STL Interview Questions

This document contains real-world, scenario-based questions often asked in C++ interviews focused on STL (Standard Template Library). Each section targets a different container or STL concept.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Vector / Array / List

- **"Youâ€™re given a list of integers. How would you remove duplicates and keep only the first occurrence of each number?"**

- **"Given a vector of integers, how would you find the second largest element without sorting the entire array?"**

- **"How can you insert a number in a sorted vector such that the vector remains sorted?"**

- **"Design a data structure that maintains a list of recent 10 items with the ability to add and remove from both ends efficiently."**

---

## ðŸ”¹ Map / Unordered Map / Multimap

- **"You are given a list of strings. How would you group them into sets of anagrams?"**

- **"How would you track the frequency of each word in a large document?"**

- **"Suppose youâ€™re implementing a spell checker. How would you efficiently store and search for dictionary words by prefix?"**

- **"You're given a log of website visits. How can you count how many times each URL was visited?"**

---

## ðŸ”¹ Set / Unordered Set / Multiset

- **"Given an array, how would you find the longest consecutive subsequence (e.g., [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2] â†’ longest is [1,2,3,4])?"**

- **"You need to store a collection of numbers where duplicates are allowed and maintain them in sorted order. Which STL container would you choose and why?"**

- **"How would you quickly check whether a given element exists in a large dataset?"**

- **"Implement a system to track top 3 scores where scores can repeat."**

---

## ðŸ”¹ Stack / Queue / Priority Queue

- **"Design a stack that supports push, pop, and retrieving the minimum element in O(1) time."**

- **"Youâ€™re given a stream of integers. How would you find the median at any point?"**

- **"Simulate an elevator system where people enter and leave based on arrival time. Which STL containers would you use?"**

- **"How would you reverse the order of words in a sentence using stack?"**

---

## ðŸ”¹ STL Algorithms

- **"You have a list of student objects. How would you sort them based on marks descending and name lexicographically if marks are equal?"**

- **"How would you check if all elements in a vector are even?"**

- **"You want to check if any string in a list starts with 'abc'. What STL function would you use?"**

- **"How would you rotate an array to the left by `k` positions in-place using STL?"**

---

## ðŸ”¹ Advanced or Real-World Patterns

- **"Youâ€™re building a leaderboard that shows the top 10 players based on scores. How would you design this using STL?"**

- **"How would you design a frequency-based autocomplete system for search terms?"**

- **"Explain how youâ€™d implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache using STL containers."**

- **"How would you merge `k` sorted lists into one sorted list using STL?"**

- **"You're processing stock prices in real-time. How do you efficiently get the current highest price?"**

### ðŸ“Œ Pro Tip

Interviewers expect more than just working code:
- Choose the right container for the job.
- Ensure thread safety if applicable.
- Be aware of time and space complexity.
- Use STL algorithms and RAII wherever possible.
